# Emergency procedures

The `mystery` command has a hidden feature that allows you to read the flag file. Its usage can be obtained by running `mystery --help`.

## Important Note

`mystery` depends on a custom runtime, which should be installed and whose dir must be appended to your system path, or else **the command will fail**.

Ensure that the runtime folder, `/opt/mystery-runtime`, is present and in your system PATH!
